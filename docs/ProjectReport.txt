1. ABSTRACT
This project implements a menu-driven Personal Health Dashboard using the C programming language. 
The system allows users to create a profile and track daily health parameters such as calorie intake,
steps walked, and body weight. It also provides BMI calculation and personalized suggestions based 
on the user's goals (Gain, Maintain, or Lose weight). The project demonstrates the use of structures, 
file handling, modular programming, and function-based program design.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this project is to apply core concepts of the C language to build a functional 
health-tracking application. The project aims to test students’ ability to:

- Use structures to store complex user information.
- Implement modular programming using multiple source files.
- Perform file operations for saving and loading user profiles.
- Apply conditional logic to generate personalized suggestions.
- Design a simple text-based interface that resembles a real-world application.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
With increasing awareness of fitness and personal health, individuals often require simple tools 
to monitor daily health metrics. However, most fitness applications are complex and require 
internet connectivity.

This project provides a beginner-friendly, offline, text-based Personal Health Dashboard that can:
- Store user details such as age, height, weight, activity level, and goals.
- Track calories consumed, steps taken, and daily weight updates.
- Calculate BMI and provide health insights.
- Offer daily suggestions based on user progress.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE
The project follows a modular structure divided into separate components:

- `main.c`  
  Handles the main menu, user flow, and high-level navigation.

- `user.c`  
  Contains functions related to user creation, loading, updating, and weight management.

- `utils.c`  
  Includes helper functions for BMI calculation, calorie calculation, and suggestions.

- Header Files (`user.h`, `utils.h`)  
  Store structure definitions and function prototypes.

**Flow of the Program**
1. Display welcome screen and login/signup options.  
2. If new user → enter all details and save to file.  
3. If returning user → load data from file.  
4. Display main menu:
   - Track Calories
   - Track Steps
   - Update Weight
   - Check BMI
   - View Suggestions
5. Update and overwrite data in file after each operation.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Key C Programming Features Used:

- **Structures**  
  To store user profile data such as name, age, height, weight, goals, calories, and steps.

- **File Handling**  
  `fopen()`, `fwrite()`, `fread()`, and `fclose()` used for persistent user data storage.

- **Functions & Modular Programming**  
  Each feature is written as a separate function for clean code organization.

- **Conditional Statements**  
  To generate suggestions depending on the user’s goals and progress.

- **Loops & Menu-Driven Interface**  
  Makes the system interactive and user-friendly.

**Example Snippet (Saving User Data):**
```c
FILE *fp = fopen("user.txt", "wb");
if (fp != NULL) {
    fwrite(&user, sizeof(struct User), 1, fp);
    fclose(fp);
} else {
    printf("Error saving user data!\n");
}
